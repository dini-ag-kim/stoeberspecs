            <p><a>ReSpec</a> is a tool for creating technical documents and web standards.</p>
            <p>
                It is a JS library that makes it easier to write technical specifications, or documents that tend to be technical
                in nature in general. It was originally designed for the purpose of writing W3C specifications, but has since grown
                to be able to support other outputs as well.
